/** Play build: there is no self-updater, by policy.

 * Google Play's Device and Network Abuse policy forbids an app from downloading
 * and installing its own updates — that is the store's job. So this flavor does
 * not merely hide the feature: the code is not here, and neither are INTERNET
 * and REQUEST_INSTALL_PACKAGES (see src/sideload/AndroidManifest.xml). An app
 * that ships a dormant updater still ships the permissions, and reviewers read
 * the manifest.
 *
 * The real implementation lives in src/sideload/. Both expose this same API so
 * MainActivity never has to know which build it is running in. */
